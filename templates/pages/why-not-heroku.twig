    <h1>What's wrong with Heroku?</h1>
    <p class="type-l m-top-l">
        Nothing. Heroku is a good hosting platform. But we can provide a better service for you with our exclusive PHP hosting. Both hosting platforms are managed â€” which means you can focus on coding, instead of dealing with servers. With both you simply <code>git push</code> to deploy.
    </p>
    <h2>PHP only</h2>
    <p>
        PHP runs our veins. Our mission is to bring <b>PHPower to the PHPeople</b>. We were the first PaaS to introduce native Composer integration. We push modern development and deployment practices and treat legacy workflows respectfully. Heroku must make sure they can run Ruby, Java, Python and whatnot - that does not come without trade-offs - while we concentrate only on PHP. Heroku doesn't do MySQL at all, with fortrabbit instead it's an integrated component.
    </p>

    <h2>Small is beautiful</h2>
    <p>
        Heroku is owned by Salesforce. They are trying to attract enterprise clients. We are  <a href="about">serious about hosting</a> and yet closer to you: <a href="freelancer-hosting">freelancer</a>, <a href="agency-hosting">digital agency</a> and <a href="startup-hosting">startup</a>. So we think that we can give you a better <a href="support">support</a>.
