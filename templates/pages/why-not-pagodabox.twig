        Pagoda Box was the first true PHP PaaS — and we love it! fortrabbit and Pagoda Box are on the same mission: <b>developers delight</b>. Apart from that, mostly everything else is different.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pagoda Box runs on SoftLayer, fortrabbit on AWS. Pagoda Box is based in the US, fortrabbit in the EU. … Not sure which one to use? Both are great. Try them out if you have the time, otherwise: ask your peers.
