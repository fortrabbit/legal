        Hosting Drupal 8 on fortrabbit
    </h2>
    <p class="type-l m-top-m">
        <b>Drupal 8</b> is a huge step forward. It features modern, object-oriented code (classes, inheritance,
        interfaces), requires at least PHP 5.4 and makes use of PHP standards  (PSR-4, namespaces, traits).
        It leverages external libraries like Guzzle, Assetic, many Symfony Components and Twig for templating. HTML5, mobile support and full multi-language integration are two more good arguments to get started with Drupal 8 right now. fortrabbit is the managed PHP hosting service made for a new generation of PHP developers. We ❤ Drupal 8.
