        Why partner with fortrabbit?
    </h2>

    <div class="post">
        <p class="type-l">
            Isn't it yet another hosting service? No. Our mission is to add value to development teams, by removing painful SysOp tasks and
            by encouraging collaborative workflows. Think of digital agencies and professional web workers.
            If you believe this service is valuable to your audience, selling is like a walk in the park.

            <h2>The audience matters</h2>
            <p>
                The fortrabbit partner program requires an application and acceptance to participate.
            </p>
            <p>
                We're looking for high quality sites about web development, reputable members in the PHP community, and those who are relevant to our business.

            <h2>Fair commissions</h2>
            <p>
                For every customer you refer, you earn a commission of <b>$50</b> &ndash; no matter what.
            </p>
            <p>
                Usually it takes some time until these customers actually use our service and discover the true value.
                At that moment you get a happy customer bonus of <b>$150</b>.

                 Affiliates will not receive commission from customers who cancel their hosting service, receive a refund, or become suspended during this period.
             </p>

             <h3 class="type-l m-top-m">Bonus Commission</h3>

                Additionally for referred customers who remain active for 6 months, we reward affiliates
                with a bonus of $150, if the total revenue by this customer during that period was $300 or higher.
