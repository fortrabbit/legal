		Laravel Forge is a great hosting meta service. It helps you setting up your VPS. But what if somethings breaks along the way?
	</p>
	<p>
		Although we also don't manage the bare metal ourselves <a href="about">anymore</a> — fortrabbit is a more classical hosting provider than Laravel Forge. We offer an end-to-end hosting experience. The fortrabbit hosting platform is an abstraction layer on top of AWS cloud infrastructure. It's an orchestration of different services; a hosting system where you can instantly launch and scale Apps — instead of servers.
	</p>
	<p>
		To ensure your <a href="sla">99.9% uptime</a> we have implemented data redundancies, failure tolerance and fail over mechanisms. It's our job to keep your business online.
	</p>
	<p>
		And <a href="laravel-hosting">we love Laravel too</a>.
