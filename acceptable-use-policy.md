THIS DRAFT WAS last reviewed on May 30th, 2018

fortrabbit is intended to be used to host websites, web-applications, and web-APIs. This policy describes forbidden uses of the fortrabbit platform. The examples described here are not exhaustive. We may modify this policy at any time. By using the services, you agree to the latest version of this policy.


## Prohibited content

It is not allowed to use, encourage, promote, facilitate or instruct others to use, the services for any illegal, harmful, fraudulent, infringing or offensive use, or to transmit, store, display, distribute or otherwise make available content that is illegal, harmful, fraudulent, infringing or offensive. This includes:

* Illegal or harmful content: Illegal contents, that violate the rights of others, or that may be harmful to others, reputation, including disseminating, promoting or facilitating child pornography, offering or disseminating fraudulent goods, services, schemes, promotions, make-money-fast schemes, ponzi and pyramid schemes, phishing, pharming, crypto-currency mining.
* Infringing content: Content that infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property or proprietary rights of others.
* Offensive content: Content that is defamatory, obscene, abusive, invasive of privacy, or otherwise objectionable, including content that constitutes child pornography, relates to bestiality, or depicts non-consensual sex acts.
* Harmful content: Content or other computer technology that may damage, interfere with, surreptitiously intercept, or expropriate any system, program, or data, including trojan horses, viruses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots, Facebook frauds.


## Prohibited actions

It is not allowed to use the services to violate the security or integrity of any network, computer or communications system, software application, or network or computing device. This includes:

* Unauthorized access: Accessing or using any system without permission, including attempting to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of a computer system or to breach any security or authentication measures.
* Interception: Monitoring of data or traffic on a computer system without permission.
* Origin falsification: Forging TCP-IP packet headers, e-mail headers, or any part of a message describing its origin or route. The legitimate use of aliases and anonymous remailers is not prohibited by this provision.


## Prohibited messaging

It is not allowed to distribute, publish, send, or facilitate the sending of unsolicited mass e-mail or other messages, promotions, advertising, or solicitations (SPAM), including advertising and informational announcements. You will not alter or obscure mail headers or assume a sender's identity without the sender's explicit permission. You will not collect replies to messages sent from another internet service provider if those messages violate this policy or the acceptable use policy of that provider.


## Quota and limits

It is not allowed to make network connections to any users, hosts, or networks unless you have permission to communicate with them. This includes:

* Monitoring or crawling: Monitoring or crawling of a computer system that impairs or disrupts the computer system being monitored or crawled.
* Denial of service (DoS): Inundating a target with communications requests so the target either cannot respond to legitimate traffic or responds so slowly that it becomes ineffective.
* Intentional interference: Interfering with the proper functioning of any System, including any deliberate attempt to overload a system by mail bombing, news bombing, broadcast attacks, or flooding techniques.
* Operation of certain network services: Operating network services like open proxies, open mail relays, or open recursive domain name servers.
Avoiding System Restrictions. Using manual or electronic means to avoid any use limitations placed on a System, such as access and storage restrictions.

The fortrabbit platform has certain soft and hard limits. Hard limits are automatically enforced by the service. Soft limits are consumable resources that you agree not to exceed. More on those limits can be found here: [help.fortrabbit.com/limits](https://help.fortrabbit.com/limits) and here: [www.fortrabbit.com/specs](https://www.fortrabbit.com/specs)


## Monitoring and enforcement

We reserve the right, but do not assume the obligation, to investigate any violation of this policy. In consequence we may: 

* remove, disable access, or even modify content.
* report any activity that we suspect violates any law or regulation to appropriate law enforcement officials, regulators, or other appropriate third parties. This reporting may include disclosing appropriate client information.
