## Code peeking

Technically, fortrabbit staff is able to view and even edit all uploaded files and databases. Our aim is to be involved as little as possible. There is an internal policy for that. In many support cases knowledge about configuration or code is essential to find a solution. Where possible and acceptable we will ask for permission to look into your code upfront. In other security related cases, for instance fighting phishing attempts, it is required that we examine code pro-actively.

Technical support is available through the web based client support system which can be found on all fortrabbit web properties.
