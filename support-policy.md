## Code peeking

Technically, fortrabbit staff is able to view and even edit all uploaded files and databases. Our aim is to be involved as little as possible. There is an internal policy for that. In many support cases knowledge about configuration or code is essential to find a solution. Where possible and acceptable we will ask for permission to look into your code upfront. In other security related cases, for instance fighting phishing attempts, it is required that we examine code pro-actively.

## Support channel

Technical support is available through the web based client support system which can be found on all fortrabbit web properties.

## Support hours

Support inquiries may be submitted at any time. 

## Response time

Every support request will be answered. The main support time frame is bound to our general office hours, Berlin. Monday — Friday, 09:00 — 17:00, excluding public holidays.

## Monitoring

The fortrabbit platform is monitored 24/7 by comprehensive automated systems. On-call schedules and escalation policies for technical support are in place.

## Incident handling

We will respond swiftly to diagnose and correct platform incidents. In the event of a bigger issue, a notice will be posted on the status site at [status.fortrabbit.com](http://status.fortrabbit.com).
